**PROBLEM DEFINITION**
Before making this application, we assumed that an airline had recently started its operation found it Very difficult to handle their customer. 
It was due to their great customer services and efficient handling of daily operations that they customer request.
The problem is that in manual airlines record keeping system, excessive staff employment is required, extremely time-consuming process is involved, inconvenience to both customer as well as to the manager.

In the existing system if any person wants to travel somewhere by flight, he should take some basic steps to get ticket like he should go to airport to book the flight ticket, he should speak with Airline help centre regarding the availability of flights. It is time consuming process.
